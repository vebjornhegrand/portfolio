## Overview
This project involved designing and building a functional mechatronic prototype to automate fish orientation in a processing line. I developed the core system concept for orientation and led the design and implementation of the sensing, control logic, and actuation mechanisms. The project was completed as part of the NTNU course Product Development. The project resulted in a working prototype, and one of only two groups to receive the top grade.

## Key Takeaways
<ul class="project-takeaways">
  <li>Achieved 93% correct orientation rate by combining sensor feedback with deterministic mechanical motion.</li>
  <li>Designed a modular mechatronic architecture that separates sensing, decision logic, and actuation for scalability.</li>
  <li>Demonstrated engineering judgment by choosing simple sensors and mechanics over complex vision systems, improving robustness and reliability.</li>
</ul>
