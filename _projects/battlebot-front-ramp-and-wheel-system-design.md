## Overview
This group project involved designing and building a BattleBot for a competitive robotics event in the subject Machine Design and Mechatronics. My responsibility was the mechanical design of the front ramp and the wheel system, developed through multiple CAD iterations in Fusion 360. The designs were validated through rapid prototyping, arena testing, and final manufacturing in aluminum and PLA.

## Key Takeaways
<ul class="project-takeaways">
  <li>Iteratively refined wheel geometry to eliminate sand buildup and belt derailment, resulting in reliable traction under competitive conditions.</li>
  <li>Balanced front ramp protection and ground clearance by redesigning geometry to prevent the robot from getting stuck while integrating the weapon mechanism.</li>
  <li>Gained practical experience translating CAD designs into manufacturable parts using 3D printing and waterjet-cut aluminum components.</li>
</ul>
