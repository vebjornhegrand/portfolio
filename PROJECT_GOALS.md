# Project Goals – Visual Engineering Portfolio

## Purpose
Create a **visual-first engineering portfolio** that presents Python and CAD projects in a way that is:
- Instantly understandable
- Visually impressive
- Professional and internship-ready

A recruiter should grasp my skills, focus areas, and technical maturity in **under 30 seconds**.

---

## Core Design Principles

### 1. Visuals Before Text
- Every project is anchored by a **strong hero visual**
- Plots, renders, animations, and diagrams come before explanations
- No source code shown unless strictly necessary

> If it doesn’t look good at a glance, it doesn’t belong.

---

### 2. At-a-Glance Comprehension
Each project must answer these questions immediately:
- What problem is being solved?
- What kind of engineering is involved?
- What was the outcome?

This is achieved through:
- One-line project summaries
- Clear sectioning
- Consistent layout across all projects

---

### 3. Minimal, Consistent Layout
- White or light neutral background
- One accent color only
- Large margins and generous spacing
- Identical structure for all project pages

Consistency > creativity.

---

### 4. Engineering-Focused Storytelling
Text is concise and technical:
- Design intent
- Key assumptions
- Constraints and trade-offs
- Results or conclusions

No filler, no narrative fluff.

## Project Page Structure (Standard)

1. **Hero Section**
   - Title
   - One-sentence description
   - Main visual (render, plot, or animation)

2. **Overview**
   - What was built
   - Why it matters
   - Context (coursework, self-driven, research)

3. **Key Visuals**
   - Supporting plots or CAD views
   - Exploded views or section cuts for CAD
   - Animations or result graphs for Python projects

4. **Key Takeaways**
   - 3 concise bullet points
   - Focus on outcomes and engineering insight

5. **Tools & Methods**
   - Python libraries or CAD software used
   - Shown as small tags, not paragraphs

---

## Visual Style Guidelines

### Python Projects
- Clean, readable plots
- Axes labeled clearly
- Neutral color palette
- Animations preferred where motion or time is involved

### CAD Projects
- Neutral backgrounds
- Soft lighting, no visual clutter
- Clear exploded and section views
- Emphasis on design intent, not surface detail

---

## Scalability & Maintenance
- Each project is a standalone Markdown file
- Adding a project requires no redesign
- Portfolio grows without losing clarity or structure

Automation and simplicity are prioritized.

---

## Success Criteria
This project is successful if:
- A recruiter understands my strengths without explanation
- The portfolio feels structured, deliberate, and polished
- Visual quality alone signals engineering competence
- Projects feel finished, not experimental

---

## Guiding Rule
**If a project cannot be explained visually and clearly, it is not ready to be published.**
